CMSI 4072 Spring 2026
Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Memoria
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Verbal Description
      Partially Complete; contains core idea and features, but needs fuller
      narrative, gameplay loop, audience definition, and scope clarity.
   Justification
      Partially Complete; shows enthusiasm and background, but lacks
      discussion of SE rigor, risks, feasibility, and alignment with
      CMSI 4072 expectations.

Proposal Presentation [Slides and video] [3 points]:
   Slides:
      REALLY beautiful title slide.  Excellent graphics throughout.  Text
      on Justification slide is a bit too verbose and kind of small which
      makes it a bit hard to read.  Same for the mechanics slide.  Try to
      use less sentence text and more bullets so that the audience will
      listen more to what you are saying and just use the bullets to help
      them remember what you've said.



Summary:
--------

Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.  Will update after video is posted.


VIDEO EVALUATION
================
This is an EXCELLENT and socially relevant project.  I'm very impressed by
the focus of this work, and I think it's a very novel use of games for
something that can be emotionally difficult for many many people.  Your
presentation is still obviously from a script which is being read, but at
least you are not just reading what's on the slides.  You are engaging
speakers, so try next time to speak more from your personal knowledge and
not from a script.

Very good job!  Five of five points on this deliverable.
