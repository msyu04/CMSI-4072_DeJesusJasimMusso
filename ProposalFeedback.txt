CMSI 4072 Spring 2026
Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Memoria
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Verbal Description
      Partially Complete; contains core idea and features, but needs fuller
      narrative, gameplay loop, audience definition, and scope clarity.
   Justification
      Partially Complete; shows enthusiasm and background, but lacks
      discussion of SE rigor, risks, feasibility, and alignment with
      CMSI 4072 expectations.

Proposal Presentation [Slides and video] [3 points]:
   Slides:
      REALLY beautiful title slide.  Excellent graphics throughout.  Text
      on Justification slide is a bit too verbose and kind of small which
      makes it a bit hard to read

Summary:
--------

Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.  Will update after video is posted.
